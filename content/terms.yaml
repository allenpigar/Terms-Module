Not all Services are available in all states. Kin is paid commissions and may receive other performance-based compensation for its Services. We do not and do not intend to sell insurance products anywhere Kin or its representatives are not licensed, although we may refer you to someone else who sells insurance in a state in which Kin or its representatives are not licensed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acceptanceofthetermsandgeneralterms\">Acceptance of the Terms and General Terms</h2>\n<p>These Terms affect your legal rights and obligations. Please read these Terms thoroughly and carefully. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and by the applicable Privacy Policy located on the Website (“Privacy Policy”). If you do not agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, then you may not access or use the Services.</p>\n<p>All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Services in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. If you use the Services on behalf of another individual, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that individual, your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that individual, and “you” and ”your” herein shall refer to you and that individual.</p>\n<p>If you access the Services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then<br />\n{{<ordered-list type=\"roman\">}}</p>\n<ol>\n<li>“You” includes you and that entity, and</li>\n<li>You represent and warrant that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms and bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity’s behalf.<br />\n{{</ordered-list>}}</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These Terms may not describe all of the terms, conditions, exclusions, and exceptions applicable to Kin’s Services. All insurance coverages are subject to the complete terms and conditions of the insurance policies issued. Coverages, terms, and conditions and their availability may vary by geographic location and individual risk circumstances. Additional terms and conditions may also apply to specific portions, services, or features of the Website. All such additional terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.</p>\n<p>The Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. If you do not meet this requirement, you must not access or use the Services.</p>\n<p>By using the Services, you agree to the use of electronic signatures in connection with the Services. All manifestations of assent, including but not limited to, click-throughs, voice recordings, and typed or digitized handwritten signatures, shall have the same legal effect as original handwritten signatures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changestotheterms\">Changes to the Terms</h2>\n<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion, and the most current version will be posted on our Website at <a href=\"/terms/\">kin.com/terms</a>. Modifications to the Terms will be effective upon the posting of the modification to the Website, and will apply to causes of action arising after thereafter. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop using the Services.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accountinformation\">Account Information</h2>\n<p>If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to this Website or portions of it using your username, password, or other security information. You will be responsible for all activity associated with your account, including any conduct which violates these Terms or our Privacy Policy. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your username or password or any other breach of security. We have the right to disable any username, password, or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Kin may, now or in the future, allow you to link your account on the Service to your account(s) on third party services, such as social networking sites (“Linked Accounts”). If you link your account on the Website to a Linked Account, you are authorizing Kin to store and use your access credentials to access your Linked Account, on your behalf as your agent, to integrate your experience with the Service with content, information, and features available through such Linked Account. This may include importing the contacts, preferences, interests, or “likes” of the Linked Account, and/or pushing updates regarding your use of the Service out to your Linked Accounts. Linking, accessing, or using a third-party service through the Service in this manner may be subject to additional terms established by the applicable third party, and it is solely your responsibility to comply with such third-party terms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changestoservices\">Changes to Services</h2>\n<p>We reserve the right to withdraw or change the Services at any time, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if, for any reason, all or any aspect of the Services is unavailable at any time or for any period.

In addition, Kin may obtain supplemental personal information about a home or homeowner from third-party sources to produce a more accurate premium estimate and to make business and/or underwriting decisions regarding the potential insurance policy (together with the information in the preceding sentence, the “Application Information”). Kin may also contact you and other parties to verify Application Information provided to Kin or to obtain or provide additional information. It is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide to Kin is correct, current, and complete.

Any coverage descriptions provided on our Website are general descriptions of available coverages and are not a statement of contract. Prices and coverage limitations included in premium estimates and quotes change based on your answers to our questions during your application, your choices for different products, or due to changes of insurance pricing guides. Whenever you leave your application prior to obtaining an insurance policy, your price may change. Your price and policy terms are not final until you sign and pay.</p>\n<h2 id=\"consumerreportsandcreditbasedinformation\">Consumer Reports and Credit-Based Information</h2>\n<p>In connection with the Services, we may review a consumer report containing credit-based information, including by obtaining or using a credit-based insurance score based on information contained in your consumer report.

Typical items from a consumer report that could affect a score include, but are not limited to, the following: claims history, payment history, number of revolving accounts, number of new accounts, the presence of collection accounts, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.</p>\n<p>We will not review your consumer report or obtain or use a credit-based insurance score when doing so violates applicable law.</p>\n<h2 id=\"communicatingwithyou\">Communicating with You</h2>\n<p>You authorize Kin to contact you at the email address or telephone number that you have provided to Kin for advertisement, telemarketing, solicitation or other purposes, including via text message, automatic telephone dialer system, and/or pre-recorded voice to deliver a message.

Coverages and availability vary by state and you may not be eligible for certain policies. We reserve the right to determine eligibility.</p>\n<p>All purchases of insurance policies are governed by important rules, conditions, exceptions, and requirements set forth in the insurance policy. Your rights and responsibilities are explained there. A copy of your insurance policy will be delivered to you after you sign and your policy is bound.</p>\n<h2 id=\"claimssubmissions\">Claims Submissions</h2>\n<p>If you elect to report an insurance claim, the information you submit regarding your insurance claim is subject to review and verification.
